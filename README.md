# Decentralized Identity Verification System

## Project Title
**Decentralized Identity Verification System**

## Project Description
The Decentralized Identity Verification System is a blockchain-based platform designed to help users securely manage and verify their digital identities. All verification data is stored on the Stellar blockchain, with the system relying on smart contracts to ensure secure identity checks and access controls. This system provides a decentralized, tamper-proof method of identity verification, ensuring users can trust the authenticity and security of their identity data.

## Project Vision
The project aims to provide a secure, decentralized platform for digital identity management. It envisions a future where users have full control over their digital identities and can share their verified data with third parties without compromising security or privacy. By utilizing the Stellar blockchain, the system ensures that identity data is immutable, easily accessible, and transparent, yet secure from unauthorized access.

## Key Features
- **Blockchain-based Identity Storage:** Identity verification data is stored on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.
- **Smart Contract Management:** Smart contracts handle identity verification processes, ensuring automated and secure identity checks.
- **Decentralized Identity Control:** Users have complete control over their digital identities and can share verified data securely with third parties.
- **Tamper-proof Verification:** Using blockchain ensures that identity records cannot be altered, providing tamper-proof verification of digital identities.
- **Secure Access Control:** Only authorized entities can access identity data, protecting user privacy and ensuring secure interactions.
